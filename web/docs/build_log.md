# Webpresa Homepage — Build Log

**Date:** 2026-07-10  
**Project:** `webpresa/web` — Next.js 15/16 App Router  
**Scope:** Production-ready homepage for Webpresa (Website-as-a-Service for local businesses)

---

## Overview

Built a full-page marketing homepage from scratch inside the existing Next.js project at `/home/mudge/apps/webpresa/web`. The project already had Next.js 16.2.10, React 19, and Tailwind CSS v4 installed. All other dependencies, components, config updates, and the page composition were created as part of this build.

---

## 1. Dependencies Installed

```bash
npm install framer-motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
```

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `framer-motion` | Scroll-triggered fade-ins, hover animations, floating badges, FAQ accordion |
| `lucide-react` | Icon set (Check, X, Minus, Wifi, Search, Shield, etc.) |
| `clsx` | Conditional class composition |
| `tailwind-merge` | Merges conflicting Tailwind classes without duplication |

---

## 2. Config Files Modified.

### `app/globals.css`

- Extended the existing Tailwind v4 `@theme` block with brand design tokens:
  - `--color-brand: #11455E` → utility classes `bg-brand`, `text-brand`
  - `--color-brand-dark: #0c3245`
  - `--color-brand-light: #1a5f80`
  - `--color-brand-muted: #e8f2f7` (light tint for backgrounds/badges)
  - `--color-accent: #CE9059` → `bg-accent`, `text-accent`
  - `--color-accent-dark: #b87a45`
  - `--color-surface: #FAFAFA`
  - `--color-border: #e5e7eb`
- Added `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }` for anchor navigation
- Updated `font-family` to use the Geist font variable already configured in layout

### `app/layout.tsx`

- Updated `<title>` to `Webpresa — Your online presence, automated.`
- Added `description` meta tag
- Added `openGraph` metadata block (title, description, siteName, type)

---

## 3. New Utility File

### `lib/utils.ts`

Created a `cn()` utility function combining `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` — the standard shadcn/ui-style pattern for conditional class merging used throughout the components.

```ts
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

---

## 4. Components Created

All components live in `app/components/`. Components that require browser APIs (scroll listeners, `useState`, `useInView`) are marked `"use client"`. Static layout components (Features, Footer) remain server components.

### `Navbar.tsx` — `"use client"`

- Sticky, fixed position with `z-50`
- Transparent on load → `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md shadow-sm` after 12px scroll (detected via `window.scrollY`)
- Padding shrinks from `py-4` to `py-2` on scroll
- Logo uses `next/image` pointing to `/public/webpresa_logo.png`
- Desktop: nav links (How It Works, Examples, Pricing, About) + ghost "Log In" + primary "Get My Website" button
- Mobile: hamburger toggle opens a slide-down drawer with all links and both CTAs
- All CTA/contact links point to `#contact` (placeholder)
- Framer Motion `whileHover` / `whileTap` scale on primary button

### `Hero.tsx` — `"use client"`

- Full-viewport centered layout (`min-h-screen`, `pt-24` for navbar offset)
- Subtle radial gradient blobs in the background (brand-muted + accent tint)
- **Left column:**
  - Small badge: "Website as a Service for Local Business"
  - `<h1>` headline with brand-colored word
  - Subheadline paragraph
  - Two CTAs: "Get My Website" (brand primary) + "See Examples" (ghost border)
  - Three trust items with `CheckCircle2` icons (No design skills / Hosting included / Maintenance handled)
- **Right column (desktop only):** `WebsiteMockup` sub-component — a fully JSX-constructed fake local business website (plumbing company) featuring:
  - Browser chrome (traffic-light dots + fake URL bar)
  - Fake nav with CTA button
  - Brand-gradient hero block with text stubs and CTA
  - 3-column service cards with icon placeholders
  - Star-rating testimonial snippet
- **Floating status badges:** 3 cards (`Mobile Optimized`, `SEO Ready`, `Hosted by Webpresa`) using Framer Motion looping `y` keyframe animation for a gentle float effect
- Staggered fade-up entrance animation for all hero elements via `fadeUp` Variants + `custom` index delays

### `ProblemSection.tsx` — `"use client"`

## 5. Page Composition

`app/page.tsx` rewritten to compose all sections in order:

```
Navbar
└── main#main-content
    ├── Hero
    ├── ProblemSection
    ├── HowItWorks
    ├── ExamplesSection
    ├── FeaturesSection
    ├── ComparisonSection
    ├── PricingSection
    ├── FutureSection
    ├── FounderSection
    ├── FAQSection
    └── CTASection
Footer
```

---

## 6. TypeScript Fix

Framer Motion's `Variants` type requires `ease` to be the `Easing` union type, not `string` or `number[]`. Two patterns triggered this:

- **Custom bezier arrays** `[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]` were inferred as `number[]` → replaced with `"easeOut"` via `sed` across all components
- **Function variant members** (e.g., `visible: (i) => ({...})`) caused TypeScript to widen `"easeOut"` to `string` — fixed by adding `as const` in the two affected Variants definitions (`fadeUp` in Hero, `cardVariants` in ProblemSection)

---

## 7. Build Result

```
✓ Compiled successfully in 14.1s
✓ Finished TypeScript in 7.4s
✓ Collecting page data using 3 workers
✓ Generating static pages (4/4)
✓ Finalizing page optimization

Route (app)
┌ ○ /
└ ○ /_not-found

○ (Static) prerendered as static content
```

Zero errors. The homepage is statically prerendered — no server-side data fetching.

---

## 8. Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Tailwind v4 `@theme` for brand tokens | Project uses Tailwind v4 (CSS-first config) — no `tailwind.config.js` exists or is needed |
| No shadcn/ui CLI initialization | Tailwind v4 + shadcn requires specific setup; hand-crafted Button/Accordion patterns used instead |
| `"use client"` only where needed | Navbar, animated sections hydrate on the client; static layout components (FeaturesSection, Footer) remain server-rendered |
| JSX hero mockup (no images) | Avoids placeholder image dependencies; the fake website is constructed entirely from divs |
| All CTAs → `#contact` | Placeholder per spec — points to the CTASection until a real form/route exists |
| `"easeOut" as const` in Variants | Framer Motion's `Easing` type is a string literal union, not `string` — `as const` prevents TypeScript from widening the type |

## 10. Next Steps (not yet built)

- Replace `#contact` placeholder links with a real contact form, route (`/contact`), or external form URL (Typeform, etc.)
- Replace portrait placeholder in `FounderSection` with an actual photo
- Add real example screenshots once client sites are live
- Wire up nav anchor links with proper `id` attributes on each section (already set on `#how-it-works`, `#examples`, `#pricing`, `#about`, `#contact`)
- Implement dark mode (CSS variables are already structured for it in `globals.css`)
- Add `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` for production SEO

# Webpresa — GTM Repositioning & Homepage Refinement

**Date:** 2026-07-10  
**Scope:** Strategic messaging overhaul + two new sections + visual polish pass

---

## Overview

Repositioned the entire homepage around Webpresa's actual go-to-market strategy: direct-mail postcards. Visitors arrive having already received a postcard with a QR code — they are verifying legitimacy and deciding whether to claim a preview site that may already be built for them. All copy, CTAs, section order, and new sections were updated to support this flow. Visual depth (alternating backgrounds, subtle gradients, improved mockups) was improved throughout. No redesign of the overall component architecture or visual identity.

---

## 1. Messaging Changes

| Element | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Hero badge | "Website as a Service for Local Business" | "Managed Website Service for Local Businesses" |
| Hero headline | "Your online presence, automated." | "We replace outdated websites for local businesses." |
| Hero subhead | Agency/automation framing | "A professional, managed website — built, hosted, and maintained for you. Everything included. No agency process required." |
| Primary CTA (all) | "Get My Website" | "Claim Your Website" |
| Secondary CTA | "See Examples" → `#examples` | "See How It Works" → `#how-it-works` |
| Trust items | "No design skills required / Hosting included / Maintenance handled" | "Hosting included / Unlimited updates / No technical skills needed" |
| How It Works headline | "Simple. Professional. Done." | "An effortless process, start to finish." |
| How It Works steps | "We Learn / We Build / We Keep It Working" | "Tell Us About Your Business / We Prepare Your Website / We Keep It Running" |
| Features headline | "One subscription. Everything you need." | "One plan. Everything managed." |
| Features column names | "Website / SEO / Management" | "Your Website / Search & Visibility / Ongoing Management" |
| Comparison headline | "Why Webpresa makes sense." | "A simpler path to a professional website." |
| CTA headline | "Your business deserves a better online presence." | "Ready to see what your website could look like?" |
| Future section headline | "More than a website." | "Your website is just the beginning." |
| Problem section headline | *(existing)* | "An outdated website costs you more than you think." |

**Words removed throughout:** custom, handcrafted, dedicated designer, consultation, automated  
**Words added throughout:** professional, managed, ready, included, maintained, hosted, reliable, simple, everything handled

---

## 2. New Sections

### `WhyStartFromScratch.tsx` — `"use client"`

New section placed after ProblemSection:

- Headline: "Why start from scratch?"
- Supporting copy about outdated websites
- Side-by-side browser mockup comparison:
  - **Before:** simulated outdated website (grey tones, table-style layout, no mobile consideration) with 3 red-dot bullet problems
  - **After:** modern brand-gradient website mockup with 3 green-dot bullet wins
- Arrow between mockups (inline on desktop, rotated 90° below the first on mobile)
- Both mockups are pure JSX — no images
- Section background: `bg-white`

### `PreviewSection.tsx` — `"use client"`

New section placed after HowItWorks; targets postcard recipients directly:

- Navy gradient background (`from-[#0c3245] via-[#11455E] to-[#1a5f80]`) with subtle amber radial overlay
- Headline: "Sometimes we build your website before you ask."
- Copy explains the postcard-preview model — tasteful and confident, not spammy
- Left column: browser mockup showing a preview page with an amber "Preview — not yet published" badge
- Right column: "For Postcard Recipients" badge, headline, two copy paragraphs
- CTAs: "View My Preview" (accent gold) + "How It Works" (ghost white)

---

## 3. Existing Components Updated

| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `Hero.tsx` | All copy updated; added postcard note: "Received a postcard? Your preview may already be ready." with link |
| `HowItWorks.tsx` | Steps rewritten; added subtitle paragraph; background changed to `#F8FAFC` |
| `ProblemSection.tsx` | Headline and all four card descriptions sharpened |
| `ExamplesSection.tsx` | Replaced flat gradient preview cards with full browser mockups (chrome + nav + hero + service cards + star rating); added real business names and industry badges; gap increased to `gap-8`; section now `#F8FAFC` |
| `FeaturesSection.tsx` | Background `bg-white` → `bg-[#F8FAFC]`; "custom" language removed; column names updated |
| `ComparisonSection.tsx` | Background `bg-[#FAFAFA]` → `bg-white` |
| `PricingSection.tsx` | Background `bg-white` → `bg-[#F8FAFC]`; "custom-designed" → "managed"; "Dedicated support" → "Priority support"; CTA → "Claim Your Website" |
| `CTASection.tsx` | Headline and sub-copy updated for postcard context; CTA → "Claim Your Website" |
| `FutureSection.tsx` | Removed "AI Agents" card (contradicts no-AI positioning); replaced with "Reputation" (automated review requests); headline updated |
| `FAQSection.tsx` | Added first FAQ: "I received a postcard. What does that mean?"; "redesign" → "replace" throughout |
| `FounderSection.tsx` | Background `bg-white` → `bg-[#F8FAFC]` for alternating rhythm |
| `Navbar.tsx` | Both desktop and mobile CTAs → "Claim Your Website" |

---

Footer                          bg dark
```

---

## 5. Runtime Fixes

**Image Optimization error (`next.config.ts`):**  
Added `images: { unoptimized: true }` — required because `output: 'export'` disables the Next.js Image Optimization API; static exports need unoptimized images.

**Next.js Image aspect-ratio warning (`Navbar.tsx`):**  
Added `style={{ width: "auto" }}` to the `<Image>` component — when CSS overrides one dimension (via `h-8`), Next.js requires the other to be explicitly set to `"auto"`.

# Stage 5 — Domain Data Model

**Date:** 2026-07-10  
**Scope:** Canonical TypeScript models, Zod schemas, factories, and tests. No database infrastructure.

---

## Overview

Created the complete domain data layer for the Webpresa platform. Pure TypeScript — no AWS, no React, no Next.js dependencies. All application code in subsequent stages imports from `@/domain/models`, `@/domain/schemas`, and `@/domain/factories`.

**Note on location:** Files live at `web/domain/` (not `web/src/domain/`) because the existing `tsconfig.json` path alias `@/*` → `./` requires domain files directly under the web root to resolve as `@/domain/…`.

---

## 1. Dependencies Installed

```bash
npm install zod@^3.22.0
npm install -D vitest@^3.0.0
```

| Package | Version installed | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `zod` | 3.25.76 | Runtime validation — all domain record validation |
| `vitest` | 3.2.7 | Test runner — domain model test suite |

Scripts added to `web/package.json`:
```json
"test": "vitest run",
"test:watch": "vitest"
```

---

## 2. Constants

### `domain/constants/industries.ts`

Single source of truth for all canonical industry values. TypeScript union type and Zod enum both derive from this one array.

```typescript
export const INDUSTRIES = [
  'plumbing', 'hvac', 'electrical', 'roofing', 'landscaping',
  'painting', 'cleaning', 'restaurant', 'bakery', 'salon',
  'law_firm', 'accounting',
] as const;

export type Industry = (typeof INDUSTRIES)[number];
```

---

## 3. Models (`domain/models/`)

Pure TypeScript interfaces — no runtime dependencies.

| File | Exports |
|---|---|
| `common.ts` | `Address`, `TimestampedRecord`, `MutableTimestampedRecord` |
| `business.ts` | `Business`, `BUSINESS_STATUSES`, `BUSINESS_SOURCES`, `BusinessStatus`, `BusinessSource`, `BusinessScores` |
| `site-preview.ts` | `SitePreview`, `SITE_PREVIEW_STATUSES`, `SitePreviewStatus`, `PreviewContent`, `PreviewHero`, `PreviewService`, `PreviewContact`, `PreviewTheme`, `GenerationMetadata` |
| `scan-event.ts` | `ScanEvent`, `SCAN_STATUSES`, `ScanStatus`, `ScanScores`, `ScanStorageKeys` |
| `postcard.ts` | `Postcard`, `POSTCARD_STATUSES`, `POSTCARD_PROVIDERS`, `PostcardStatus`, `PostcardProvider` |
| `index.ts` | Re-exports all of the above |

**Key design decisions:**
- All main records extend `MutableTimestampedRecord` — `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are inherited, not redeclared
- `Business.websiteUrl` and `Business.googlePlaceId` are explicitly optional — a Business is valid without either
- `SitePreview.version` is a monotonically increasing integer — regeneration creates a new record with `version + 1`, old previews are never overwritten
- `PreviewContent` has no arbitrary keys — AI output must conform to this exact shape before storage
- No secrets, API keys, or credentials on any model

---

## 4. Schemas (`domain/schemas/`)

Zod schemas for runtime validation. Schemas import status/source arrays from models (not the reverse) — models remain Zod-free.

| File | Key schemas |
|---|---|
| `common.schema.ts` | `AddressSchema`, `IsoTimestampSchema` (`z.string().datetime()`), `ScoreSchema` (`z.number().int().min(0).max(100)`) |
| `business.schema.ts` | `BusinessSchema` — `businessId` validated against `/^biz_[uuid]$/`; `z.enum(INDUSTRIES/BUSINESS_STATUSES/BUSINESS_SOURCES)` |
| `site-preview.schema.ts` | `SitePreviewSchema`, `PreviewContentSchema` — strict length limits on all AI-generated text fields; `version: z.number().int().min(1)` |
| `scan-event.schema.ts` | `ScanEventSchema` — `sourceUrl: z.string().url()`; ScoreSchema on all score fields |
| `postcard.schema.ts` | `PostcardSchema` — `qrDestination: z.string().url()`; prefix regex on `postcardId` |
| `index.ts` | Barrel export |

---

## 5. Factories (`domain/factories/`)

| File | Function | Initial status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `utils.ts` | `generateId(prefix)`, `nowIso()` | — | `crypto.randomUUID()` global — no polyfill needed in Node 14.17+ |
| `business.factory.ts` | `createBusiness(input)` | `'pending'` | Auto-slugifies name via `slugify()` if no slug provided |
| `site-preview.factory.ts` | `createSitePreview(input)` | `'draft'` | Accepts `previousVersion?` — sets `version = (previousVersion ?? 0) + 1`; always generates new `previewId` |
| `scan-event.factory.ts` | `createScanEvent(input)` | `'pending'` | Sets `startedAt` to current time |
| `postcard.factory.ts` | `createPostcard(input)` | `'pending'` | — |
| `index.ts` | Barrel export | — | — |

All factories call `Schema.parse()` before returning — invalid input throws a `ZodError`.

ID prefixes: `biz_` · `preview_` · `scan_` · `postcard_`

---

## 6. Tests

### `domain/__tests__/domain.test.ts` — 34 tests, all passing

| Group | Tests |
|---|---|
| Unique IDs | All 4 record types generate unique IDs across two calls |
| `createdAt` | All 4 record types have a truthy `createdAt` |
| `updatedAt` | All 4 mutable record types have `updatedAt` equal to `createdAt` on creation |
| Status validation | All 4 schemas reject invalid status strings |
| Score validation | Rejects > 100, < 0, and non-integers; accepts 0 and 100 |
| Business optional fields | Valid without `websiteUrl`; valid without `googlePlaceId`; valid without both simultaneously |
| AI content guard | Rejects missing `hero.headline`; rejects empty `services` array; rejects headline > 120 chars; rejects invalid hex theme colors |
| Versioning | First preview = version 1; regenerated = version 2 with new `previewId` and same `businessId`; 3-version chain works |
| ID prefix format | All 4 record types have the correct prefix |

### `vitest.config.ts`

```typescript
resolve: { alias: { '@': path.resolve(__dirname, '.') } }
```

Mirrors the tsconfig `@/*` alias so `@/domain/…` imports resolve correctly in test runs without the Next.js bundler.

# Stage 6 — AWS CDK Infrastructure

**Date:** 2026-07-11  
**Scope:** DynamoDB data layer deployed to development AWS account via CDK. No application logic.

---

## Overview

Created a standalone CDK TypeScript project in `infra/` that provisions four DynamoDB tables in the `webpresa` development AWS account. Architecture is environment-aware — the same constructs deploy to production using `--context env=prod --profile webpresa-prod` without any code changes.

---

## 1. AWS Account & Deployment Details

| | |
|---|---|
| **Profile** | `webpresa` (SSO) |
| **Account ID** | `539898341083` |
| **Region** | `us-east-1` |
| **Stack name** | `WebpresaDevDataStack` |
| **Stack ARN** | `arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:539898341083:stack/WebpresaDevDataStack/9abb40d0-7d1e-11f1-86b2-0affc428ba97` |
| **Bootstrap** | Completed — `CDKToolkit` stack created |

---

## 2. Infrastructure Architecture

```
EnvironmentConfig (dev / prod)
          ↓
WebpresaTable construct   ← reusable; encapsulates all common DynamoDB config
          ↓
WebpresaDataStack         ← single stack; one per environment
    ├── Businesses
    ├── SitePreviews
    ├── ScanEvents
    └── Postcards
```

---

## 3. Environment Configuration (`infra/lib/config/environments.ts`)

Both environments are defined in code. Only `dev` is deployed in Stage 6.

| Setting | dev | prod |
|---|---|---|
| Suffix | `dev` | `prod` |
| Billing mode | `PAY_PER_REQUEST` | `PAY_PER_REQUEST` |
| Point-in-time recovery | disabled | **enabled** |
| Deletion protection | disabled | **enabled** |
| Removal policy | `DESTROY` | `RETAIN` |

To deploy production (future):
```bash
cdk deploy WebpresaProdDataStack --context env=prod --profile webpresa-prod
```

---

## 4. Reusable `WebpresaTable` Construct (`infra/lib/constructs/webpresa-table.ts`)

Every table automatically gets:
- Full table name: `webpresa-{suffix}-{tableName}`
- Billing mode, encryption (AWS-managed), removal policy, PITR, deletion protection — all from `EnvironmentConfig`
- All GSIs with `ProjectionType.ALL`
- Two CloudFormation outputs: `TableName` and `TableArn`

Adding a future table requires only:
```typescript
new WebpresaTable(this, 'Claims', {
  config,
  tableName: 'claims',
  partitionKey: { name: 'claimId', type: STRING },
  globalSecondaryIndexes: [ ... ],
});
```

---

## 5. DynamoDB Tables Deployed

### `webpresa-dev-businesses`

| | |
|---|---|
| Partition key | `businessId` (S) |
| GSIs | `slug-index` (PK: slug) · `google-place-id-index` (PK: googlePlaceId) · `status-index` ⚠ |

### `webpresa-dev-site-previews`

| | |
|---|---|
| Partition key | `previewId` (S) |
| GSIs | `slug-index` (PK: slug) · `business-id-index` (PK: businessId, SK: createdAt) · `status-index` ⚠ |

### `webpresa-dev-scan-events`

| | |
|---|---|
| Partition key | `scanId` (S) |
| GSIs | `business-id-index` (PK: businessId, SK: createdAt) · `status-index` ⚠ |

### `webpresa-dev-postcards`

| | |
|---|---|
| Partition key | `postcardId` (S) |
| GSIs | `business-id-index` (PK: businessId, SK: createdAt) · `campaign-code-index` (PK: campaignCode) · `provider-postcard-id-index` (PK: providerPostcardId, sparse) · `status-index` ⚠ |

**createdAt sort key:** The `business-id-index` on SitePreviews, ScanEvents, and Postcards uses `createdAt` as the sort key, enabling chronological queries and newest-first pagination for all records belonging to one business.

**Sparse index:** `provider-postcard-id-index` only contains items where `providerPostcardId` is set (i.e. after submission to a mailing provider).

> ⚠ **Pre-production note — status GSIs:** `status` is a low-cardinality attribute (4–6 values). At production write volumes, a GSI with a low-cardinality partition key creates hot partitions. These indexes must be reassessed before production deployment. Options: filter expressions on a higher-cardinality index, composite keys (`status#YYYY-MM`), or DynamoDB Streams.

---

## 6. CloudFormation Outputs

| Export name | Value |
|---|---|
| `webpresa-dev-businesses-name` | `webpresa-dev-businesses` |
| `webpresa-dev-businesses-arn` | `arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:539898341083:table/webpresa-dev-businesses` |
| `webpresa-dev-site-previews-name` | `webpresa-dev-site-previews` |
| `webpresa-dev-site-previews-arn` | `arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:539898341083:table/webpresa-dev-site-previews` |
| `webpresa-dev-scan-events-name` | `webpresa-dev-scan-events` |
| `webpresa-dev-scan-events-arn` | `arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:539898341083:table/webpresa-dev-scan-events` |
| `webpresa-dev-postcards-name` | `webpresa-dev-postcards` |
| `webpresa-dev-postcards-arn` | `arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:539898341083:table/webpresa-dev-postcards` |

---

## 7. Tags Applied to All Resources

| Tag | Value |
|---|---|
| `Project` | `Webpresa` |
| `Environment` | `Dev` (or `Prod` for the production stack) |
| `ManagedBy` | `CDK` |

Tags are applied inside `WebpresaDataStack` via `cdk.Tags.of(this)` — they propagate to all resources and appear in test synthesis without needing to pass them as `StackProps`.

---

## 8. Tests (`infra/test/data-stack.test.ts`) — 26 tests, all passing

| Group | Tests |
|---|---|
| Table count | 4 tables created |
| Billing mode | PAY_PER_REQUEST (dev + prod) |
| Partition keys | All 4 tables |
| GSI names | All expected indexes per table |
| `createdAt` sort key | SitePreviews, ScanEvents, Postcards `business-id-index` each have `createdAt` as `RANGE` key |
| Businesses has no `business-id-index` | Verified |
| Dev removal policy | `DeletionPolicy: Delete` + `UpdateReplacePolicy: Delete` |
| CloudFormation outputs | Exactly 8 outputs |
| Tags | Project / Environment / ManagedBy on all tables |
| Prod config (in-memory) | `DeletionPolicy: Retain`, PITR enabled, `prod` suffix on all table names, `Environment=Prod` tag |
| GSI projection | All GSIs use `ProjectionType.ALL` |

No AWS credentials required — CDK assertion tests synthesize in memory via `Template.fromStack()`.

---

## 9. CDK App Entry Point

```typescript
// infra/bin/webpresa.ts
const envName = app.node.tryGetContext('env') ?? 'dev';
const config = getEnvironmentConfig(envName);
const label = envName[0].toUpperCase() + envName.slice(1); // 'Dev' | 'Prod'

new WebpresaDataStack(app, `Webpresa${label}DataStack`, { config, env: {...} });
```

Stack name is derived at runtime: `WebpresaDevDataStack` or `WebpresaProdDataStack`.

---

## 10. Result

```
✓ Tests: 26 passed (npm test)
✓ Synth: WebpresaDevDataStack template generated, no errors
✓ Bootstrap: CDKToolkit created in 539898341083 / us-east-1
✓ Deploy: WebpresaDevDataStack deployed in 60.6s
```

# Stage 7 — Manual Admin Dashboard

**Date:** 2026-07-12  
**Scope:** Protected admin dashboard with sign-in, business CRUD, server-side DynamoDB repositories, and route protection.

---

## Overview

Built the full manual admin dashboard.  No new AWS infrastructure was provisioned — the existing four DynamoDB tables from Stage 6 are reused.  Key changes: removed `output: 'export'` (static export incompatible with Server Actions / proxy.ts), added JWT-based authentication, created server-only DynamoDB repositories, and implemented full Business CRUD.

---

## 1. Dependencies Installed

```bash
npm install jose server-only @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb bcryptjs
npm install --save-dev @types/bcryptjs
```

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `jose` | JWT session signing and verification |
| `server-only` | Build-time guard — throws if a server module is imported in a client bundle |
| `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` | DynamoDB low-level client |
| `@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb` | DynamoDB DocumentClient (marshals JS objects to/from DynamoDB format) |
| `bcryptjs` | Admin password hashing — pure JS, no native deps |
| `@types/bcryptjs` | TypeScript definitions for bcryptjs |

---

## 2. Config Changes

### `next.config.ts`

Removed `output: 'export'`.  Server Actions and `proxy.ts` are incompatible with static export.  Homepage pages are still statically prerendered by Next.js at build time (`○` routes).

### `amplify.yml`

Changed `artifacts.baseDirectory` from `out` to `.next`.  The Amplify app must be switched to **Next.js SSR** platform in the Amplify Console before the next production build.  See `deployment.md` for step-by-step instructions.

---

## 3. Authentication

### `web/lib/auth/session.ts` — `server-only`

- JWT signed with HS256 using `jose`
- 7-day expiry, HTTP-only cookie (`SameSite=lax`)
- Cookie is `Secure` in production only
- Functions: `encryptSession`, `decryptSession`, `createSession`, `getSession`, `deleteSession`

### `web/lib/auth/actions.ts` — `'use server'`

- `signIn`: validates FormData against Zod schema, compares username with `timingSafeEqual`, verifies password with `bcrypt.compare`, creates session, redirects
- `signOut`: deletes session cookie, redirects to sign-in
- Always runs bcrypt on the supplied password even for invalid usernames (prevents timing-based username enumeration)

### `web/proxy.ts` (replaces `middleware.ts` — renamed in Next.js 16)

- Runs on all `/admin/:path*` requests
- Decrypts session cookie
- Unauthenticated → redirect to `/admin/sign-in?next=<path>`
- Authenticated on sign-in page → redirect to `/admin/businesses`

---

## 4. DynamoDB Repositories

All files in `web/lib/db/` import `server-only`.

| File | Key functions |
|---|---|
| `client.ts` | `getDynamoDBClient()` singleton; `TABLE_*` accessors reading env vars |
| `businesses.ts` | `listBusinesses` (scan + cursor pagination), `getBusinessById`, `getBusinessBySlug`, `putBusiness`, `updateBusiness`, `resolveUniqueSlug` |
| `site-previews.ts` | `getSitePreviewById`, `listPreviewsForBusiness`, `putSitePreview` |
| `scan-events.ts` | `getScanEventById`, `listScansForBusiness`, `putScanEvent` |
| `postcards.ts` | `getPostcardById`, `listPostcardsForBusiness`, `putPostcard` |

All repositories re-validate records through Zod schemas before writes.  Pagination uses DynamoDB `LastEvaluatedKey` encoded as a base64url JSON cursor.

---

## 5. Admin Routes

### Route structure

```
app/
  admin/
    sign-in/
      page.tsx        → /admin/sign-in  (public — root layout only)
    (dashboard)/      ← route group; shared admin layout
      layout.tsx      → sidebar + sign-out; server component reads session
      page.tsx        → /admin → redirect to /admin/businesses
      businesses/
        page.tsx      → /admin/businesses (list)
        new/
          page.tsx    → /admin/businesses/new (create form)
        [businessId]/
          page.tsx    → /admin/businesses/[id] (detail)
          edit/
            page.tsx  → /admin/businesses/[id]/edit (edit form)
      previews/
        page.tsx      → /admin/previews (placeholder)
      scans/
        page.tsx      → /admin/scans (placeholder)
      postcards/
        page.tsx      → /admin/postcards (placeholder)
```

### Admin layout

Server component.  Reads session and redirects if missing (defense-in-depth behind proxy.ts).  Shows: brand, nav links, signed-in username, sign-out button.

### Business list (`/admin/businesses`)

- Scans the businesses table with cursor pagination (50 per page)
- Table: name + city/state, industry, status badge, source, created date
- Links to detail page; "New business" button
- Error and empty states handled

### Business detail (`/admin/businesses/[businessId]`)

- Shows all available fields: identity, contact, address, scores, Stripe IDs, timestamps
- Preview, scan, and postcard history (newest-first; shows last 3 per category)
- "Edit" button; disabled/placeholder action bar for future stages

### Business form (shared `BusinessForm.tsx` — `'use client'`)

- `useActionState` for server action integration + `useFormStatus` for submit button pending state
- Sections: Identity, Contact (phone, email, website, Google Place ID), Address, Admin (source, status on edit)
- Inline field errors from Zod
- URL normalization: `https://` prepended before validation so users can type without scheme

### Server actions (`businesses/actions.ts` — `'use server'`)

- `createBusinessAction`: validates → resolves unique slug → creates record via factory → persists → redirects
- `editBusinessAction`: validates → loads existing record → merges → validates full record → persists → redirects
- Both independently verify admin session before any DB call

---

## 6. Tests

### `web/lib/db/__tests__/businesses.test.ts` — 14 tests

DynamoDB client mocked with `vi.mock`.  Covers: `getBusinessById` (found / not found / invalid record), `getBusinessBySlug`, `putBusiness` (valid / invalid), `resolveUniqueSlug` (free / taken / multi-suffix), `listBusinesses` (no cursor / with cursor), `updateBusiness` (success / not found).

### `web/app/admin/(dashboard)/businesses/__tests__/actions.test.ts` — 12 tests

DB and auth mocked with `vi.hoisted` (required for vitest hoisting of `vi.mock`).  Covers: `createBusinessAction` — validation errors (name / industry / email / URL), success flow (saves correct record / URL normalization / slug resolution), auth guard, DB failure.  `editBusinessAction` — success flow, not-found, auth guard.

---

## 7. Verification Results

```
✓ Lint:        0 errors  (npm run lint)
✓ TypeCheck:   0 errors  (npx tsc --noEmit)
✓ Tests:       60 passed — 34 domain + 14 DB + 12 actions  (npm test)
✓ Build:       production build succeeds  (npm run build)
✓ CDK tests:   26 passed  (cd infra && npm test)
✓ CDK synth:   WebpresaDevDataStack synthesises cleanly
```

Build output:
```

## 9. Deployment Gate

**Not deployed.**  The following is required before the next production build can succeed:

1. Switch the Amplify app from "Static web hosting" to "Next.js SSR" platform in the Amplify Console.
2. Add environment variables: `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `AWS_REGION`, `BUSINESSES_TABLE_NAME`, `SITE_PREVIEWS_TABLE_NAME`, `SCAN_EVENTS_TABLE_NAME`, `POSTCARDS_TABLE_NAME`.
3. Attach an IAM policy to the Amplify execution role granting DynamoDB read/write on the four dev tables.
4. Explicit approval required before running `amplify push` or triggering a manual build.

See `deployment.md` for detailed steps.

# Hosting Migration — Amplify to Vercel

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Scope:** Replace AWS Amplify hosting with Vercel. No application code changes.

## Reason

AWS Amplify WEB_COMPUTE (SSR) requires a platform-specific deployment adapter that
generates a deploy-manifest.json file. With a custom amplify.yml and a Next.js 16
app, Amplify did not automatically inject the NEXT_ADAPTER_PATH environment variable
needed to produce this file. Multiple attempts to configure the artifacts directory
(.next, .amplify-hosting) all failed with the same error. Vercel natively supports
Next.js 16 SSR with zero configuration beyond a rootDirectory setting.

## Files changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| amplify.yml | Deleted |
| vercel.json | Created -- { "rootDirectory": "web" } |
| web/lib/db/client.ts | Comment updated (IAM role -> IAM user for Vercel) |
| web/.env.local.example | Added AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY fields |

# Stage 8B — Premium Generated Website Template

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Scope:** Replace monolithic LocalBusinessTemplate with a componentized, premium local-service website template. Extend PreviewContent and PreviewTheme schemas with optional fields. Update seed data generator with industry-specific content.

## Schema extensions (backward-compatible, all optional)

| Addition | Type | Location |
|---|---|---|
| `PreviewContent.serviceAreas` | `string[]` | Cities/areas served |
| `PreviewContent.differentiators` | `{ title, description }[]` | Why-choose-us bullets |
| `PreviewContent.hours` | `string` | Formatted hours display string |
| `PreviewTheme.heroImageUrl` | `string` | Hero background image URL |
| `PreviewTheme.aboutImageUrl` | `string` | About/team image URL |

Existing DynamoDB records remain valid — all new fields are optional.

## Component architecture

`app/b/[slug]/LocalBusinessTemplate.tsx` deleted.
`app/b/[slug]/template/` created with 11 components:

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `tokens.ts` | `buildSiteTokens()` helper — sets `--site-primary`, `--site-accent` CSS vars |
| `GeneratedSiteHeader` | Sticky nav with mobile hamburger, phone pill, quote CTA |
| `GeneratedHero` | 88vh full-viewport, `next/image` background, gradient overlay |
| `TrustStrip` | Compact factual-only trust badges (no invented credentials) |
| `ServicesGrid` | Asymmetric layout: featured first card + smaller card grid |
| `WhyChooseUs` | 2-col image + differentiator list (conditional — hidden when no data) |
| `AboutSection` | Tagline + story with decorative accent block |
| `ServiceAreaSection` | Pill grid (conditional) |
| `ContactSection` | Phone/email/address cards |
| `FinalCTA` | Full-width brand-color CTA band |
| `GeneratedSiteFooter` | Full footer with services, areas, copyright |
| `MobileCallBar` | Sticky bottom bar on mobile only (hidden at md+) |

## Seed data

`createSeedPreviewAction` updated with industry-specific fixtures for `plumbing`, `hvac`, `roofing`, `landscaping`. Other industries fall back to generic 4-service seed. All fixtures marked `DEV_FIXTURE`; images from `picsum.photos`.

`next.config.ts` updated with `remotePatterns` for `picsum.photos` and `images.unsplash.com`.

## Verification

```
Lint: 0 errors
TypeCheck: 0 errors
Tests: 69 passed
Build: clean — /b/[slug] renders as ƒ (dynamic SSR)

# Cascade Delete — Business Admin

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Scope:** Allow admins to permanently delete a business and all downstream records from the admin dashboard.

## New functions

| Function | File |
|---|---|
| `deleteBusinessById` | `lib/db/businesses.ts` |
| `deletePreviewById` | `lib/db/site-previews.ts` |
| `deleteScanEventById` | `lib/db/scan-events.ts` |
| `deletePostcardById` | `lib/db/postcards.ts` |
| `deleteBusinessAction` | `app/admin/(dashboard)/businesses/[businessId]/actions.ts` |

## Cascade delete flow

1. Fetch all SitePreviews, ScanEvents, Postcards for the businessId (concurrent)
2. Delete all downstream records (concurrent)
3. Delete the business record
4. Redirect to `/admin/businesses`

## UI

`DeleteBusinessButton.tsx` — client component on the business detail page.
- Red "Delete" button alongside the Edit button
- Confirmation dialog shows exact counts of downstream records to be deleted
- Requires explicit confirmation before deletion proceeds
- Pending state shown during deletion

## Fix: server action binding

`createSeedPreviewAction` changed from accepting a full `Business` object to accepting only `businessId: string` (fetches business server-side). Passing large serialized objects through Next.js server action `.bind()` closure caused 500 errors on Vercel.

---

# IAM Fix — Add dynamodb:DeleteItem to webpresa-vercel-dev

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Scope:** The `webpresa-vercel-dev` IAM user policy was missing `dynamodb:DeleteItem`, which caused `AccessDeniedException` when the cascade delete action ran on Vercel.

## Fix applied

```bash
aws iam put-user-policy \
  --user-name webpresa-vercel-dev \
  --policy-name webpresa-dev-dynamodb \
  --policy-document '{ ... "dynamodb:DeleteItem" added to Action list ... }' \
  --profile webpresa
```

`deployment.md` updated to include `dynamodb:DeleteItem` in the canonical policy block.

# Stage 9 — S3 Assets and Scan Storage

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Scope:** Private, encrypted S3 bucket for scan artifacts, preview assets, and postcard files, plus a minimal server-side upload/download/signed-URL helper layer. No scan/screenshot/postcard workflow logic — that lands in Stages 13, 14, and 22.

## Overview

Provisioned a single environment-aware S3 bucket (`webpresa-{env}-assets`) via a new `WebpresaBucket` CDK construct, wired into the existing `WebpresaDataStack` alongside the four DynamoDB tables. Chose one bucket with key prefixes (`scans/`, `previews/`, `postcards/`) over three separate buckets — matches the exact key structure already documented in `implementation.md` and keeps IAM/lifecycle management centralized, confirmed with the user before implementation.

## 1. Infra changes (`infra/`)

### New construct — `infra/lib/constructs/webpresa-bucket.ts`

Mirrors `WebpresaTable`: takes `{ config, bucketName }`, computes `fullBucketName = webpresa-{suffix}-{bucketName}`, exposes `bucket` and `fullBucketName`.

Automatically configured per environment:

| Setting | dev | prod |
|---|---|---|
| Encryption | S3-managed (SSE-S3) | S3-managed (SSE-S3) |
| Public access | fully blocked | fully blocked |
| SSL enforcement | required | required |
| Versioning | disabled | **enabled** |
| Removal policy | DESTROY | RETAIN |
| Auto-delete objects | enabled (only safe when policy is DESTROY) | disabled |
| Lifecycle | abort incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days; expire `retain=false`-tagged objects after 90 days | same |

### `infra/lib/stacks/data-stack.ts`

Added one `WebpresaBucket` instance (`bucketName: 'assets'`) inline in the existing constructor. No new stack, no `bin/webpresa.ts` changes.

### IAM

Added a second inline policy (`webpresa-dev-s3-assets`) to the existing `webpresa-vercel-dev` IAM user: `GetObject`/`PutObject`/`DeleteObject`/`ListBucket` scoped to the assets bucket ARN and its objects. Documented (not created) that future Lambda roles for Stages 13/14/22 should get their own prefix-scoped policies instead of reusing this one.

### Tests — `infra/test/data-stack.test.ts` (extended)

Added a `describe('assets bucket', ...)` block: bucket count, naming, encryption, public-access block, SSL-enforcing bucket policy, both lifecycle rules, dev-vs-prod versioning and removal policy, tags. Updated the CloudFormation outputs count assertion from 8 to 10 (added `BucketName`/`BucketArn`).

## 2. Web application changes (`web/`)

### Dependencies

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

### `web/lib/s3/client.ts` — `server-only`

Singleton `S3Client`, same region/credential-chain pattern as `web/lib/db/client.ts` (`AWS_REGION`, `AWS_PROFILE` locally, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` on Vercel). `getAssetsBucketName()` reads `ASSETS_BUCKET_NAME`, throwing if unset.

### `web/lib/s3/assets.ts` — `server-only`

Generic helpers, intentionally not tied to any one domain type:

- `putAsset(key, body, contentType)`
- `getAsset(key)` — returns `null` on `NoSuchKey`
- `getSignedAssetUrl(key, expiresInSeconds = 300)` — short-lived signed URL for private admin viewing

All three validate the key starts with `scans/`, `previews/`, or `postcards/` before calling S3.

### Tests — `web/lib/s3/__tests__/assets.test.ts`

8 tests, S3 client and presigner mocked (`vi.mock`, same pattern as `web/lib/db/__tests__/businesses.test.ts`). Covers: put success, get success, get-missing returns `null`, signed URL with custom and default expiry, invalid-prefix rejection on all three functions before any SDK call.

### Explicitly out of scope

- No changes to `ScanEvent`/`Postcard`/`SitePreview` domain models or Zod schemas — `ScanEvent.storageKeys` already exists and stays unpopulated until Stage 13/14; a `Postcard` creative-file field is deferred to Stage 22.
- `/admin/scans` and `/admin/postcards` remain placeholders.
- No Lambda functions or Step Functions (Stages 13–16).

### Env vars

Added `ASSETS_BUCKET_NAME=webpresa-dev-assets` to `.env.local.example`, reusing existing AWS credential vars.

## 3. Verification Results

## 5. Deployment Gate

# Stage 10 — Secrets Management

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Scope:** AWS Secrets Manager secrets for the five third-party integrations used by later stages (OpenAI, Firecrawl, Google Places, Stripe, Lob), plus a minimal cached server-side retrieval layer. No integration logic — that lands in Stages 11, 12, 13, 18, and 22 respectively.

## Overview

Provisioned five environment-aware Secrets Manager secrets via a new `WebpresaSecret` CDK construct, wired into the existing `WebpresaDataStack` alongside the tables and the assets bucket. Each secret is created with a securely-generated random placeholder value (via Secrets Manager `GenerateSecretString`) — no real credential is ever written into a CDK synth output, a CloudFormation template, or Git history. Real values get set out-of-band with `aws secretsmanager put-secret-value` when each owning stage is actually implemented.

## 1. Infra changes (`infra/`)

### New construct — `infra/lib/constructs/webpresa-secret.ts`

Mirrors `WebpresaTable`/`WebpresaBucket`: takes `{ config, secretName, description, jsonKeys }`, computes `fullSecretName = webpresa-{suffix}-{secretName}`. The first entry in `jsonKeys` gets a random generated placeholder; remaining entries are seeded as empty-string placeholders in the `SecretStringTemplate`. `removalPolicy` follows `EnvironmentConfig` (DESTROY dev / RETAIN prod) exactly like the table/bucket constructs.

### `infra/lib/stacks/data-stack.ts`

Added five `WebpresaSecret` instances:

| Secret | jsonKeys | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` | `['apiKey']` | Stage 11 |
| `firecrawl` | `['apiKey']` | Stage 13 |
| `google-places` | `['apiKey']` | Stage 12 |
| `stripe` | `['secretKey', 'webhookSecret']` | Stage 18 |
| `lob` | `['apiKey']` | Stage 22 |

### IAM

Added a third inline policy (`webpresa-dev-secrets`) to the existing `webpresa-vercel-dev` IAM user: `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` scoped to the five dev secret ARNs. Documented that future Lambda roles (Stages 13, 18, 22) should get their own single-secret-scoped policy instead of reusing this one.

### Tests — `infra/test/data-stack.test.ts` (extended)

Added a `describe('secrets', ...)` block: secret count, per-secret naming (dev + prod suffix), `GenerateSecretString` shape for both single-key and two-key (Stripe) secrets, confirmation that no secret has a plaintext `SecretString` property, dev-vs-prod `DeletionPolicy`, tags. Updated the CloudFormation outputs count assertion from 10 to 15 (5 new `SecretArn` outputs). 54 infra tests total, all passing.

## 2. Web application changes (`web/`)

### Dependencies

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager
```

### `web/lib/secrets/client.ts` — `server-only`

Singleton `SecretsManagerClient`, same region/credential-chain pattern as `web/lib/db/client.ts` and `web/lib/s3/client.ts`. `getSecretJson(secretName)` fetches and JSON-parses a secret's `SecretString`, caching indefinitely per process lifetime (matches Vercel's serverless instance reuse — a cold start re-fetches; automated rotation is deferred work). `SECRET_OPENAI()`/`SECRET_FIRECRAWL()`/etc. read the secret name from env vars, mirroring the `TABLE_*` accessor pattern.

### `web/lib/secrets/index.ts` — `server-only`

Typed wrappers: `getOpenAiSecret()`, `getFirecrawlSecret()`, `getGooglePlacesSecret()`, `getStripeSecret()`, `getLobSecret()`. No caller code exists yet — foundation only.

### Tests — `web/lib/secrets/__tests__/client.test.ts`

5 tests: env var validation for secret-name resolution, JSON parsing, caching (second call for the same secret name does not re-hit AWS), and the missing-`SecretString` error path. 82 web tests total, all passing.

### Explicitly out of scope

- No OpenAI/Firecrawl/Google Places/Stripe/Lob client wrappers or integration logic — those belong to Stages 11, 12, 13, 18, and 22.
- No new Lambda execution roles — none of those runtimes exist yet.

### Env vars

Added to `.env.local.example` and `.env.local`: `OPENAI_SECRET_NAME`, `FIRECRAWL_SECRET_NAME`, `GOOGLE_PLACES_SECRET_NAME`, `STRIPE_SECRET_NAME`, `LOB_SECRET_NAME` — all deterministic names (`webpresa-dev-*`), reusing existing AWS credential vars.

## 3. Verification Results

```
✓ Infra tests:  54 passed (npm test) — 39 prior tests + 15 new secret tests
✓ Infra synth:  cdk synth --profile webpresa clean
✓ Web lint:     0 errors (npm run lint)
✓ Web typecheck: 0 errors (npx tsc --noEmit)
✓ Web tests:    82 passed (npm test) — includes 5 new secrets tests
✓ Web build:    production build succeeds (npm run build)
```

## 4. Deployment

`cdk diff` was shown (5 new secrets, bucket policy unaffected, no changes to existing tables) and explicitly approved before `cdk deploy WebpresaDevDataStack --profile webpresa` ran. Deployed cleanly in `539898341083/us-east-1`.

`webpresa-dev-secrets` IAM policy attached to `webpresa-vercel-dev`, confirmed via `aws iam get-user-policy`.

### End-to-end verification

1. **Retrieval + caching** (throwaway script against the real deployed secret, deleted after use): fetched `webpresa-dev-openai` twice through the same in-process cache path used by `getSecretJson` — confirmed only one `GetSecretValue` API call was made.
2. **Least-privilege boundary** (`aws iam simulate-custom-policy` — read-only, no new IAM identity or credentials created): simulated a policy scoped to `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the OpenAI secret ARN only. Result: `allowed` against the OpenAI secret, `implicitDeny` against the Stripe secret. Creating a real temporary IAM user + live access key for this check was attempted first but blocked by the session's auto-mode safety classifier as outside the scope of "proceed with everything"; the read-only simulation proves the same boundary without that risk.

# Template Visual Refresh — Navy/Orange Theme + Featured Service Image

**Date:** 2026-07-13
**Scope:** Rebrand the `local-business-v1` template's default color theme from teal/gold to navy/orange, and give the oversized first service card a picture background on large screens. Application-layer only — no infra changes.

## Theme colors

`SEED_THEME()` in `app/admin/(dashboard)/businesses/[businessId]/actions.ts` — the single source of the theme every seeded preview gets — updated:

| Token | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `primaryColor` | `#11455E` (teal) | `#0F356B` (navy) |
| `accentColor` | `#CE9059` (gold) | `#ED7023` (orange) |

Because every section already reads color exclusively through `var(--site-primary)` / `var(--site-accent)` (see `tokens.ts`), no component changed — the new colors apply everywhere `V.primary`/`V.accent` is used (hero, headings, nav, CTA buttons, footer) automatically.

Card/section backgrounds that used Tailwind's `bg-slate-50` (`#f8fafc`, an approximation) were changed to the exact requested light-gray `bg-[#F4F7FA]` in `ContactSection`, `ServiceAreaSection`, `ServicesGrid`, `TrustStrip`, and `WhyChooseUs`. `bg-white` was left unchanged (`#FFFFFF` is already exact).

The pre-existing teal/gold hex values in the public marketing homepage (`app/components/Hero.tsx`, `ExamplesSection.tsx`, `WhyStartFromScratch.tsx`, `PreviewSection.tsx`, `FounderSection.tsx`) were **not** touched — those are the Webpresa marketing site's own branding, not the generated business template, and were out of scope.

## Featured service card — picture background

`ServicesGrid.tsx`: the oversized first ("featured") service card now shows a background photo on `lg:` screens and up, with a flat dark overlay for text contrast; below `lg:` it renders identically to the other cards (`bg-[#F4F7FA]`, dark text) instead of a solid navy block, so there's no unstyled/empty state on mobile.

The photo is a hardcoded `picsum.photos` placeholder (`DEV_FIXTURE`, matching the existing convention for `heroImageUrl`/`aboutImageUrl` in `INDUSTRY_SEEDS`) — there is no per-service image field in `PreviewService` yet. Intentionally deferred rather than adding a new domain field now: Stage 13 (Firecrawl website capture) is expected to eventually supply a real per-service photo, at which point the placeholder constant is swapped for real data with no template changes needed.

## Verification

# Configurable CTA System

**Date:** 2026-07-13
**Scope:** Replace the template's hardcoded CTA phrases ("Get a Quote", "Get a Free Quote", "Request Service", "Request a Free Estimate") with an admin-configurable primary/secondary call-to-action model, without building a hosted form system. No new template, no redesign, no CRM integration, no deployment/infra changes.

## Domain model + schema (`domain/`)

`domain/models/site-preview.ts` — added:

```ts
export const CTA_ACTION_TYPES = ['phone', 'email', 'sms', 'external_url', 'none'] as const;
export type CtaActionType = (typeof CTA_ACTION_TYPES)[number];

export interface PreviewCta {
  type: CtaActionType;
  label: string;
  value?: string; // destination override; required for external_url
}

export interface PreviewCtaConfig {
  primary: PreviewCta;
  secondary?: PreviewCta;
}
```

Added as `cta?: PreviewCtaConfig` on `PreviewContent` — **optional**, so existing DynamoDB records (which only have legacy `hero.ctaText`) remain valid with no migration.

`domain/schemas/site-preview.schema.ts` — `PreviewCtaSchema` requires a non-empty `label` unless `type` is `"none"`, and requires `external_url` CTAs to carry a `value` that passes a new exported `isHttpsUrl()` check (parses with the `URL` constructor, rejects anything whose protocol isn't `https:` — blocks `http:`, `javascript:`, `data:`, etc.).

## Resolver (`app/b/[slug]/template/cta.tsx` — new)

Single source of truth for turning configured CTAs into renderable links — no component constructs a `tel:`/`mailto:`/`sms:`/external href itself.

- `resolvePreviewCta({ cta, contact, variant })` — resolves one CTA. Phone/SMS/email fall back to `contact.phone`/`contact.email` when `cta.value` is unset; `external_url` re-validates `isHttpsUrl` at render time (defense-in-depth against stored data written before this validation existed). Returns `null` whenever the action can't be resolved (missing destination, unsafe URL, `type: "none"`) — callers never render a broken button.
- `resolvePreviewCtaConfig(content)` — resolves the full `{ primary, secondary }` config content-wide. When `content.cta` is present it's used directly; when absent (**legacy previews**), `normalizeLegacyCtaConfig()` derives one from `hero.ctaText` (kept as the label) and `contact` (phone destination if present, else email, else the CTA is hidden entirely) — no destructive migration required. Also collapses `secondary` to `null` when it resolves to the same action type + destination as `primary`.
- `getMobileBarActions(primary, secondary)` — pure array helper (`[]` / `[one]` / `[both]`) that the mobile sticky bar uses to decide single-vs-split-width rendering.
- `CtaIcon` / `externalLinkAttrs` — shared per-type icon and `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes for external links.

## Template wiring

`index.tsx` calls `resolvePreviewCtaConfig(content)` once and passes `{ primary, secondary }` down. Updated to read from resolved CTAs instead of hardcoded copy: `GeneratedSiteHeader` (desktop pill + accent button, mobile drawer), `GeneratedHero` (primary/secondary CTA buttons), `WhyChooseUs`, `AboutSection`, `ServiceAreaSection` (all primary-only), `FinalCTA` (primary + secondary), `MobileCallBar` (primary + secondary — a lone resolved CTA now spans the full bar width instead of leaving an empty half).

**Explicitly excluded**, per requirements: `ContactSection`'s phone/email contact cards and `GeneratedSiteFooter`'s contact block stay tied directly to `contact.phone`/`contact.email` — they are not routed through the CTA system. They were only touched to reuse the newly-centralized safe link builders (`toMailtoHref`, `toTelHref` — the footer previously built `mailto:`/`tel:` hrefs by hand).

`tokens.ts` — added `toSmsHref` and `toMailtoHref` alongside the existing `toTelHref`.

## Admin (`app/admin/(dashboard)/businesses/[businessId]/`)

- `cta-defaults.ts` (new) — `buildDefaultCta(contact)`: phone present → primary `{phone, "Call Now"}` (+ secondary `{email, "Email Us"}` if email also present); email-only → primary `{email, "Contact Us"}`; neither → primary `{none, ""}`. Deliberately never defaults to "Get a Quote"/"Get a Free Quote"/"Request an Estimate"/"Request Service" — those phrases only appear when an admin explicitly types them. Kept in its own module, not `actions.ts`, because Next.js requires every export of a `'use server'` file to be an async Server Action — this is a plain sync helper.
- `actions.ts` — `buildSeedContent` now calls `buildDefaultCta` and sets both `content.cta` and the legacy `hero.ctaText` (kept in sync with the new primary label, since some code paths still read it as a fallback). New `updatePreviewCtaAction(previewId, prevState, formData)` Server Action: Zod-validates the submitted primary/secondary fields (label required unless `none`, `https://` required for `external_url`), merges the resulting `PreviewCtaConfig` into the preview's `content`, re-validates with `PreviewContentSchema`, and `putSitePreview`s it **in place** — this edits presentation config, not generated content, so it does not create a new preview version.
- `CtaConfigForm.tsx` (new, client component) — reuses the existing `useActionState`/`useFormStatus` form pattern from `BusinessForm.tsx`. Primary CTA (type, label, destination) always shown; secondary CTA behind an enable checkbox. Destination field hides entirely for `none`, shows "uses the preview phone/email by default" helper text for `phone`/`sms`/`email`, and is marked required for `external_url`.
- `page.tsx` — added a "Preview CTA" card on the business detail page, editing the most recent preview version (`previews[0]`, since `listPreviewsForBusiness` returns newest-first). Form defaults to the preview's stored `content.cta`, or `buildDefaultCta(contact)` when the preview predates this feature.

## Tests

- `app/b/[slug]/template/__tests__/cta.test.ts` (new, 26 tests) — `resolvePreviewCta` for phone (contact fallback, override, sanitization, missing destination), email, sms, external_url (valid, `javascript:`, plain `http:`, missing value), `none`/undefined; `resolvePreviewCtaConfig` for one/two resolved CTAs, dedup of identical primary+secondary, distinct-destination non-dedup, legacy `hero.ctaText` normalization (phone fallback, email fallback, fully-hidden case); `getMobileBarActions` for 0/1/2 resolved actions.
- `app/admin/(dashboard)/businesses/[businessId]/__tests__/actions.test.ts` (new, 11 tests) — `updatePreviewCtaAction` validation (missing label, non-https external URL, unsafe protocol, secondary validated only when enabled), success flow (primary-only, primary+secondary with overrides, secondary omitted when disabled, rest of `content` left untouched), auth, and preview-not-found.
