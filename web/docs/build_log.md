# Webpresa Homepage — Build Log

**Date:** 2026-07-10  
**Project:** `webpresa/web` — Next.js 15/16 App Router  
**Scope:** Production-ready homepage for Webpresa (Website-as-a-Service for local businesses)

---

## Overview

Built a full-page marketing homepage from scratch inside the existing Next.js project at `/home/mudge/apps/webpresa/web`. The project already had Next.js 16.2.10, React 19, and Tailwind CSS v4 installed. All other dependencies, components, config updates, and the page composition were created as part of this build.

---

## 1. Dependencies Installed

```bash
npm install framer-motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
```

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `framer-motion` | Scroll-triggered fade-ins, hover animations, floating badges, FAQ accordion |
| `lucide-react` | Icon set (Check, X, Minus, Wifi, Search, Shield, etc.) |
| `clsx` | Conditional class composition |
| `tailwind-merge` | Merges conflicting Tailwind classes without duplication |

---

## 2. Config Files Modified

### `app/globals.css`

- Extended the existing Tailwind v4 `@theme` block with brand design tokens:
  - `--color-brand: #11455E` → utility classes `bg-brand`, `text-brand`
  - `--color-brand-dark: #0c3245`
  - `--color-brand-light: #1a5f80`
  - `--color-brand-muted: #e8f2f7` (light tint for backgrounds/badges)
  - `--color-accent: #CE9059` → `bg-accent`, `text-accent`
  - `--color-accent-dark: #b87a45`
  - `--color-surface: #FAFAFA`
  - `--color-border: #e5e7eb`
- Added `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }` for anchor navigation
- Updated `font-family` to use the Geist font variable already configured in layout

### `app/layout.tsx`

- Updated `<title>` to `Webpresa — Your online presence, automated.`
- Added `description` meta tag
- Added `openGraph` metadata block (title, description, siteName, type)

---

## 3. New Utility File

### `lib/utils.ts`

Created a `cn()` utility function combining `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` — the standard shadcn/ui-style pattern for conditional class merging used throughout the components.

```ts
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

---

## 4. Components Created

All components live in `app/components/`. Components that require browser APIs (scroll listeners, `useState`, `useInView`) are marked `"use client"`. Static layout components (Features, Footer) remain server components.

### `Navbar.tsx` — `"use client"`

- Sticky, fixed position with `z-50`
- Transparent on load → `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md shadow-sm` after 12px scroll (detected via `window.scrollY`)
- Padding shrinks from `py-4` to `py-2` on scroll
- Logo uses `next/image` pointing to `/public/webpresa_logo.png`
- Desktop: nav links (How It Works, Examples, Pricing, About) + ghost "Log In" + primary "Get My Website" button
- Mobile: hamburger toggle opens a slide-down drawer with all links and both CTAs
- All CTA/contact links point to `#contact` (placeholder)
- Framer Motion `whileHover` / `whileTap` scale on primary button

### `Hero.tsx` — `"use client"`

- Full-viewport centered layout (`min-h-screen`, `pt-24` for navbar offset)

  - Small badge: "Website as a Service for Local Business"
  - `<h1>` headline with brand-colored word

  - Three trust items with `CheckCircle2` icons (No design skills / Hosting included / Maintenance handled)
- **Right column (desktop only):** `WebsiteMockup` sub-component — a fully JSX-constructed fake local business website (plumbing company) featuring:
  - Browser chrome (traffic-light dots + fake URL bar)
  - Fake nav with CTA button
  - Brand-gradient hero block with text stubs and CTA
  - 3-column service cards with icon placeholders

## 5. Page Composition

`app/page.tsx` rewritten to compose all sections in order:

```
Navbar
└── main#main-content
    ├── Hero
    ├── ProblemSection
    ├── HowItWorks
    ├── ExamplesSection
    ├── FeaturesSection
    ├── ComparisonSection
    ├── PricingSection
    ├── FutureSection
    ├── FounderSection
    ├── FAQSection
    └── CTASection
Footer
```

---

## 6. TypeScript Fix

Framer Motion's `Variants` type requires `ease` to be the `Easing` union type, not `string` or `number[]`. Two patterns triggered this:

- **Custom bezier arrays** `[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]` were inferred as `number[]` → replaced with `"easeOut"` via `sed` across all components
- **Function variant members** (e.g., `visible: (i) => ({...})`) caused TypeScript to widen `"easeOut"` to `string` — fixed by adding `as const` in the two affected Variants definitions (`fadeUp` in Hero, `cardVariants` in ProblemSection)

---

## 7. Build Result

```
✓ Compiled successfully in 14.1s
✓ Finished TypeScript in 7.4s
✓ Collecting page data using 3 workers
✓ Generating static pages (4/4)
✓ Finalizing page optimization

Route (app)
┌ ○ /
└ ○ /_not-found

○ (Static) prerendered as static content
```

Zero errors. The homepage is statically prerendered — no server-side data fetching.

---

## 8. Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Tailwind v4 `@theme` for brand tokens | Project uses Tailwind v4 (CSS-first config) — no `tailwind.config.js` exists or is needed |
| No shadcn/ui CLI initialization | Tailwind v4 + shadcn requires specific setup; hand-crafted Button/Accordion patterns used instead |
| `"use client"` only where needed | Navbar, animated sections hydrate on the client; static layout components (FeaturesSection, Footer) remain server-rendered |
| JSX hero mockup (no images) | Avoids placeholder image dependencies; the fake website is constructed entirely from divs |
| All CTAs → `#contact` | Placeholder per spec — points to the CTASection until a real form/route exists |
| `"easeOut" as const` in Variants | Framer Motion's `Easing` type is a string literal union, not `string` — `as const` prevents TypeScript from widening the type |

## 10. Next Steps (not yet built)

- Replace `#contact` placeholder links with a real contact form, route (`/contact`), or external form URL (Typeform, etc.)
- Replace portrait placeholder in `FounderSection` with an actual photo
- Add real example screenshots once client sites are live
- Wire up nav anchor links with proper `id` attributes on each section (already set on `#how-it-works`, `#examples`, `#pricing`, `#about`, `#contact`)
- Implement dark mode (CSS variables are already structured for it in `globals.css`)
- Add `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` for production SEO
